# Nanoservices-utils

This package is for giving utils to other Rust servers such as:

- JWT
- Config
- error handling for server endpoints
- runtime state

These will help the developer use these tools outside of the box to have uniform runtime states, config handles, and 
error handling for api endpoints. This will enable developers to fuse servers together to call endpoints via memory.
